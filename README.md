# Safu Chrome Extension

A chrome extension for managing your Ethereum addresses, storing your private
keys securely, and quickly checking to make sure your _funds are safu_.

### Development
1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
3. Open Chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked
4. Select the `safu-extension/dist` folder

NOTE: After making changes, you'll need to close and re-open the extension to load the latest build.

### Smart Contract

The smart contract that powers Safu's balance fetching is up at
[wbobeirne/balance-checker](https://github.com/wbobeirne/balance-checker).
That repo will continue to be expanded upon as its own project separately
from the Safu extension.

### About the Team

Safu was put together at ETHSanFrancisco 2018 by the team behind
[Grant.io](https://grant.io/). You can keep up with the project on its
twitter account [@SafuApp](https://twitter.com/SafuApp).
